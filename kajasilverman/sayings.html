"The and and and is eternal"
<br>
"The Camera obscura being the pure here and now, oriented towards the future. (There is always more coming)"
<br>
"the here and now of the before is where all of the people are"
<br>
"an image becomes a thing by becoming one of the visibles, by becoming a thing in the world"
<br>
The site in front of the photographic as a site of happiness. I call this "the before."
<br>
"to be all inside the world we have to be half inside a picture and half outside a picture"
<br>
"a second where, a where that is social, one that we can step into. the place before the picture. The Before"
<br>
"a politic without care is a cruel politic"
<br>
"Being is our double beloning the order of the subject and the object. Our being is cohabitation. The saying yes to each other"
<br>
"A photograph isnt just an analogy it is also a picture. The back and forth between us and the world is around its pictrial aspects and not its analogical ones."
<br>
"the ethical reality of the everyday"
<br>
"the pictorial drive at the heart of being is the drive to be seen" 

and the type of encounter that seeing makes possible.  

trying to get to the politcal through form 

formalism is not just form for forms sake 

form matters

if you want to let the world in again, let the picture in again
